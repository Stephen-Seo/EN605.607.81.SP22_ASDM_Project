# Release Plan

The first Sprint will focus on developing the Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

Every Sprint afterwards will iterate on the MVP until it reaches enough
maturity, or in other words, has implemented all the main features.

After the main features have been implemented, every Sprint afterwards will
refine the product. See the `technical_release_plan.md` for technical details.
