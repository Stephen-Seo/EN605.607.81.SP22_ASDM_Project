# Release Plan

The first Sprint will focus on developing the Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

Every Sprint afterwards will iterate on the MVP until it reaches enough
maturity, or in other words, has implemented all the main features.

After the main features have been implemented, every Sprint afterwards will
refine the product. See the `technical_release_plan.md` for technical details.

# Sprints

The first Sprint will focus on creating the prototype that will serve as the
Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

Every Sprint afterwards will choose and work on User Stories that are ideally
the highest priority (at the time) and of lowest estimated size (priority takes
precedence, but low sizes are ideal).
